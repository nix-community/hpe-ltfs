Building HPE-SOS from source code
=======================================================================

1.	Unpack the archive source file to a suitable location, for example
	/usr/local/src/ :

	$ gunzip HPE-SOS_SOURCE.tar.gz
	$ tar xf HPE-SOS_SOURCE.tar

2.	Required Software packages - HPE StoreOpen Software 3.4.2 requires the
        following software packages on Linux. Make sure that these packages
        are installed on the target computer.
   
	1. libicu 50.1.2
	2. libicu-devel 50.1.2
	3. fuse 2.8.5 or higher (kernel and shared library modules)
	4. fuse-libs 2.8.5 or higher
	5. libxml2-2.7.6
	6. e2fsprogs 1.41

	For example:
	$ rpm -q icu libicu-devel fuse fuse-libs fuse-devel
	
	icu-50.1.2
	libicu-devel-50.1.2
	fuse-2.8.5-1
	fuse-libs-2.8.5-1
	fuse-devel-2.8.5-1

	If any of the packages are not installed, then you must add them 
	from the installation DVD or other repository.

	Note that further packages may need to be installed, depending on your
	current system configuration.  These may include uuid (part of the
	e2fsprogs package) and libxml2.

3.	Run the configure script
	$ cd hpe-sos_3.4.2
	$ ./configure

	This will check for various dependencies; you must correct any problems
	before you can proceed.

4.	Build the package
	$ make

5.	Copy the compiled files to the correct locations
	$ make install

	The executables (ltfs, mkltfs, ltfsck) are placed in /usr/local/bin/
	The supporting dynamic files are placed under /usr/local/lib/

6.	On some systems it may be necessary to tell the linker/loader how to
	locate the required dynamic library files.  There are several ways
	of doing this:
	a) Add /usr/local/lib/ to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	or
	b) (As root) Add /usr/local/lib/ to the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and
	then execute ldconfig
	Refer to the man pages for ld.so and ldconfig for further details.

7.	That's it! Refer to the README file for details of how to use LTFS.
